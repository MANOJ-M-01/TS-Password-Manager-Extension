Perfect — that log means the check is working, and your app is **running in a regular browser tab (not as a loaded Chrome extension)**.

So what's happening:

- ✅ Your encryption, IndexedDB storage, etc., are all working fine.
- 🚫 But `chrome.storage.local` only exists when your code is executed **inside the extension environment** (i.e., after loading it from `chrome://extensions`).

---

## ✅ How to See `chrome.storage.local` Work

To test syncing with `chrome.storage.local`, follow these steps:

### 1. Run a build

```bash
npm run build
```

### 2. Open Chrome Extensions

Go to:  
`chrome://extensions`

### 3. Enable Developer Mode (toggle top right)

### 4. Click "Load unpacked"

Then **select the `dist/` folder** from your project.

> Make sure it contains the built files like `index.html`, `assets/`, `manifest.json`, etc.

### 5. Click on your extension’s popup (icon next to the address bar)

Click **“Add Dummy Entry”** — now you should see:

```
[Vault] Synced to chrome.storage.local ✅
```

You can then open the **DevTools for the popup**, or run:

```js
chrome.storage.local.get("vault", console.log)
```

in the console.
